For ANTON:

From Krajcovic:
- responsivnes on small screen(300 px for some reason...wtf why 300px??)
- add section, article, header, footer tags somewhere
- a lot of free space from sides of page(not neccessary i think, only if you would want to)

Adding product and editing product:
- Add functionality to enforce that user needs to add AT LEAST two photos when creating new product(it is one of the condition on GH).
- For cart functionalities, make sure that fields for order cannot be filled with inproper values(like phone number having letters etc.)

Also, please test admin functionality, if it works, if any problem let me know and i will fix it!

If there is anything you would like to change, go for it.
Also we will go over the docs, but that shouldnt be a problem.
